<ol>
<li>Go to your partners contacts and open the contact you want to share.</li>
<li>Hold the two devices back to back (they have to be almost touching) and you’ll feel a vibration.</li>
<li>After it vibrates you’ll see the content on your partners device turn into a card-like object with Star Trek warp speed-looking animation in the background.</li>
<li>Tap the card and the content will then load on the your device.</li>
